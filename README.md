#Scipts
This repo contains a collection of useful scripts written over time. Contains scripts for:
* Environment setup when switching to a new machine.
* Autoit Scripts to automate some windows functionality.
* Python utilities for file renaming, etc.

Additionally, the rare folder contains scripts that once used to be useful, but now no longer are used that often.
